## 🚨 Common Questions & Answers

### Q: "How accurate is the AI?"
**A**: "85-95% accuracy using Groq's LLaMA 3.2 Vision model. Users can override if needed."

### Q: "Is blockchain really necessary?"
**A**: "Absolutely. It ensures votes can't be manipulated by anyone - not even admins. Full transparency."

### Q: "How do you calculate cost savings?"
**A**: "Based on industry data: fixing a pothole early costs $500, but waiting until it's severe costs $5,000+. We multiply by cluster size and severity trends."

### Q: "What about privacy?"
**A**: "Anonymous by default. No personal data required. Location is only for the report, not the user."

### Q: "Can this scale to large cities?"
**A**: "Yes! Firebase handles millions of documents. We use pagination, lazy loading, and efficient queries."

### Q: "What's the business model?"
**A**: "SaaS for cities: $5K-50K/year based on population. ROI is 10x through cost savings."
